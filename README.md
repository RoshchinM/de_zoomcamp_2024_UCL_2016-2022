# de_zoomcamp_2024_UCL_2016-2022
Final project for DE zoomcamp 2024


# Problem description:

The UEFA Champions League is a focal point of global football, attracting millions of viewers and generating significant interest from fans, analysts, and sponsors alike. One of the critical aspects for stakeholders is understanding team performance metrics, particularly those relating to stadium attendance and player contributions. Currently, there is a gap in the market for a sophisticated analysis tool that can provide insights into which teams draw the most fans to their home matches and which players are most influential in terms of goals and assists. This gap hinders the ability of sponsors to make informed decisions on where to allocate advertising budgets for maximum exposure and return on investment. Additionally, football clubs and analysts lack precise data to strategize and optimize both team performance and fan engagement.

# Project Objective:

The goal is to create an advanced analytical model and dashboard that provide in-depth insights into the UEFA Champions League statistics, focusing on two main areas: stadium attendance and player performance metrics. The project will leverage existing data on match attendance, goals, and assists to:

1) Identify the football clubs that consistently attract the highest number of fans to their home stadium matches, thereby pinpointing the most lucrative venues for sponsor advertisements.
2) Analyze player performance by quantifying goals and assists to reveal top performers who can potentially be the face of advertising campaigns, enhancing brand visibility and engagement.
By implementing this solution, sponsors can make data-driven decisions on advertising placements, while football clubs and analysts can gain valuable insights into enhancing team performance and fan experience. The project aims to bridge the gap in current sports analytics offerings, providing a comprehensive tool for a range of stakeholders in the football industry.

# Technologies
In this project I mostly used the tools that I learned from Data-Eng-zoomcamp-2024

1) Google Cloud Storage - datalake to store raw dataset in buckets
2) Mage for data orchestration
3) Terraform
4) Google BigQuery - data warehouse.
5) Dbt cloud - for developing Analytical Views 
6) Looker - visualization dashboard with main metrics that will helps to find ingsights from data

### 3) Terraform

1) Download terraform [download page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)
2)  Add the Terraform binary to the system PATH
3) Check version
```
$ terraform version
Terraform v1.7.5
on windows_amd64
```

4) Establish a connection with your cloud service: Set up API credentials or employ a service account key file for verification with your cloud provider.
5) Start a Terraform project: In the command line interface, go to your Terraform project's main directory and execute the command below to initialize the project:

```
terraform init
```
6) Generate and Execute Change Plan: 

Utilize the commands below to formulate an action plan and implement modifications to your infrastructure:

This command crafts an execution blueprint that outlines the prospective changes to your infrastructure. Scrutinize this blueprint to confirm it matches your intentions.

```
terraform plan 
```

Execute this command to put the planned changes into effect. You'll need to endorse the actions by typing 'yes' when prompted to proceed.

```
terraform apply 
```
7) Infrastructure Oversight: 
Leverage Terraformâ€™s suite of commands such as ```plan```, ```apply```, ```destroy```, among others, to control and modify your infrastructure over time. For detailed command specifications and further assistance, consult the Terraform documentation to explore the full array of commands at your disposal.

### 4) Google Cloud Storage/Big query
